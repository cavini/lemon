I'm sorry I didn't reply earlier, I had a very busy last couple of days.

All of the acceptance criteria have been met.
I used node's v20.10.0


Just run npm install and npm run start to see the server in action.
I used postman to make the requests to test it.
You can also run npm test to see the tests I made.
